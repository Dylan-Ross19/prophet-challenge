I have tasked with being a growth analyst at MercadoLibre, the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. I need to analyze the company's finicial and user data to make the company grow. 

## Step 1: Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic
### 1. Read the search data into a Dataframe, and then sliced the data to just the month of May 2020.
   I would say the trends for May 2020 are pretty straightforward. We have low seach traffic in the overnight, and high search traffic during the day. May 4th and May 5th had a uptick in searches due to the quarterly report being released.
### 2. Calculated total search traffic for the month. Compared values to monthly median across all months.
   The total search traffic for May 2020 was 38181, and we found the median search traffic acrros all months was 35172.5. The comparison is a difference of 1% increase of search traffic, or just around 3000 more searches.
## Step 2: Mine the search traffic data for seasonality

## Step 3: Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns

## Step 4: Create a time series model with Prophet.
